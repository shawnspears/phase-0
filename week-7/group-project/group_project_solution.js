// Release 1: Tests to User Stories (Shawn Spears)

// ------ User Stories ------

// As a user, I want to be able to be able to take two ordered lists of integers, and find the
// sum, mean, and median of each (Three different stories).

// The first list contains 7 integers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, and 7. Therefore the length of this list is 7,
// which is odd. If I had to name it, I would call it the odd length list.

// The second list contains 8 integers: 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, and 7. Therefore the length of this list
// is 8, which is even. If I had to name it, I would call it the even length list.

// I want to find the sum, mean, and median of each of these lists separately, so separate functions
// would probably be the best way for me to get the results I want:

// ------ Story 1 ------

// In the sum function, if I inputted either the odd length or even length list of integers, it should 
// return in the sum of those integers. 

// ------ Story 2 ------

// In the mean function, if I inputted either the odd length or even length list of integers, it should
// return the average of those integers as a decimal point number.

// ------ Story 3 ------

// In the median function, if I inputted either the odd length or even length list of integers, it should
// return the median of those integers as a decimal point number. 

// (If you've forgotten what the median is, it is simply the middle value in a list of values. For an odd
// numbered list of values, there is an obvious middle as the two other halves apart from the middle value 
// can be separated equally. In an even list, there will be two middle values -- the median will be the 
// average of these values.)
