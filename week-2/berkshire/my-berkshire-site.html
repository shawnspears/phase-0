- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  I thought it was a nice change of pace to start implementing our knowledge of HTML in practice! I am very much a hands on person, so I would rather be learning from just jumping in and trying myself. It was nice to not only be able to recall information about HTML that I previously knew, but to also learn more layout elements that I wasn't familiar with.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  This was probably the most interest portion of this challenge! I took an intro programming class in undergrad, and more some reason we were taught to basically use <div> elements for everything in combination with class and id attributes. I always thought that the process was somehwat unorganized, so learning about the new semantic elements seemed like a really effective way to be able to stylize separate portions of a layout in a more organized manner.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  I thought I did fairly well! I really left the HTML page as more of a skeleton rather than anything that was formatted. I hope that is what this question refers to as "best practices". I figure that it would be best to leave it as simple as possible, and then transform certain elemnts to mimic the final website using CSS.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
  I think what is good about HTML is the fact that it allows you to very simply set up the skeleton for a webpage without getting overly complciated. The syntax is as least complicated as it could be, and it doesn't require a lot of work to get something up and running. That being said, I think that is also what might be bad about it as well? Adding design and functionality requires the use of more languages (but I don't necesarrily view this as a bad thing actually). 
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  I think what has helped me most in remembering HTML is to just get out there and actively practing just building something with HTML, and be confident that you know the basic elements. Using resources such as jsfiddle have made it painless to just go and experiment with different tags and see immediately what it would translate to if you ran it. Making mistakes and correcting them have helped me learn more than just attempting to memorize everything on flashcards.
