# 2.3 Design Reflection

1. What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
	The 6 phases of web design are information gathering, planning, design, devleopment, and testing & delivery.

	1. Information Gathering: This phase of the design process lays the foundation for the other phases to follow. It is important to consider the following factors with regards to the objective of the company that the website was created for: purpose of the site, company goals for the site, target audience, and content with respect to the target audience.

	2. Planning: This phase incorporates all of the factors considered in the information gathering stage into a site map. The site map lists all areas of the site, and provides a navigational layout. The planning phase also considers the technologies implemented in the site.

	3. Design: The design phase starts to draft what the visual aesthetic for the website (logo, color schemes, and other elements that build brand identity) might look like while taking audience into most consideration. Mock ups of the website should be created at this time and reviewed by the company.

	4. Development: In the development phase, the website will be created using front-end languages. The index page is created first in order to have a template (same header, footer) for the rest of the pages planned in the sitemap.

	5. Testing and Delivery: The web designer will test for functionality, and make sure that the site adheres to the current standards for design and development. Once reviewed and approved, the site will then be uploaded to the serve using File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Search engine optimization should also be considered at this time.

	6. Maintenance: This involves updating the content in oder to ensure vistors.

2. What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
	My site's primary goal would be both career oriented and personal, so essentially the main purpose is to give visitors a sense of who I am, as well as my career goals. It would likely feature an about me page, contact information, blog posts, as well as my projects.

3. What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
	My target audience would be anyone who wants to know more about me and what my career interests are, so my site would address that by showcasing content that answers those questions.

4. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
	I would imagine that the primary action that a user would take would be to first view an about me page if this is their first visit, and then likely look at my portfolio (projects). I suppose if they were interested even further they would read through my blog posts, or contact me.

5. What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
	There is such an expanse of information on the topic, but I suppose to put it simply, design isn't just about the visual aesthetics of a website. Design incorporates a lot of different factors to make a much better user experience for the user. Design is about problem solving, and its a process that involves a lot of experimentation, and trial and error, and finding out what a user has to say (or not have to say, these can be visual cues) about an interface. Design, however, is still deeply rooted in the user interface, and the graphical aesthetic. What user's don't pick up on, however, is the fact that the interface is designed with purpose, and with psychological and scientific context behind every design decision.

6. What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
	User experience design, to put it simply, is how a person interacts with an interface and how they feel when they interact with said interface. It is so valuable because interfaces should be both beautiful and functional. They should have a certain ease of use, and be accesible to all users. Aesthetics play such a significant unconscious role in how we perceive certain things, and the emotions that are associated with that experience. This could work to the advantage of what the website is trying to accomplish, but it also requires a psychological and biological background in which to design these interfaces with. 

7. Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
	Honestly I found no part of this challenge tedious. I really enjoyed learning about UX design more in depth, as that is what initially made me interested in becoming a developer.
