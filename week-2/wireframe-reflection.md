# 2.4 Wireframe Reflection


1. What is a wireframe?


	A wireframe is the a vital element of the design process where you are able to create a draft of the webpage that has a layout of the basic sections of an interface.


2. What are the benefits of wireframing?


	Developers can describe the hierarchy of information of a website through a wireframe which is important when planning how the content in a site ir organized. Wireframing is also beneficial from a UI/UX design standpoint, as creating a basic wireframe can determine how the user interacts with your interface draft so you can make improvements.



3. Did you enjoy wireframing your site?


	I really enjoyed wireframing my site! I enjoy thinking about where certain elements will go in teh end result, and how it can be translated into an HTML page.


4. Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?


	I ended up revisiing my wireframe, as I realized that I didn't really have much of a header that signified that it was a personal website. I essentially used the GitHub logo in place of a logo that I would design myself.


5. What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?


	I tried to ask myself how I would be able to incorporate an effective and positive user experience while creating a design for my index page, as that would be the first page that a user would arrive at. I ended up reading up on user-centered design, and found advice through Don Norman who coined the term. His advice really focused on simplifying the experience first and foremost, and focusing on aesthetics afterwards.


6. Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?


	I found the wireframing process itself to be an experience that I really enjoyed, whereas I would imagine attempting to translate it into HTML would be tedious.
