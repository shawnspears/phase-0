# Reverse Words

# I worked on this challenge [by myself].
# This challenge took me [1] hours.

# Pseudocode
# 1. Separate the words in the string
# 2. Reverse each word separately so that they're still in the same order
# 3. Print the string
# 4. END

# Initial Solution

def reverse_words(string)
  split = string.split(" ")
  split.map! do |word|
    word.reverse()
  end
  p split.join(" ")
end

# Refactored Solution

def reverse_words(string)
  split = string.split(" ")
  split.map! do |word|
    word.reverse()
  end
  p split.join(" ")
end

# Reflection
# What concepts did you review or learn in this challenge?
#   I reviewed the syntax for the split and join methods, as the rspec wantsed the
#   words to be reversed in a fairly specific manner (the words in the sentence were
#   still in order, however the words themselves were reversed). This lead to having
#   to split the words where there were spaces rather than just reversing the entire
#   sentence.

# What is still confusing to you about Ruby?
#   Honestly compared to JS, I'm know just getting tripped up on the simple syntax 
#   and not having excess notation. I guess what is still somewhat tripping me up
#   are classes and the scope of particular objects within them, but for the most
#   part I know my way around instance/local variables.

# What are you going to study to get more prepared for Phase 1?
#   I'm going to try and get through all of these Ruby challenges by the end of next
#   week to really test my knowledge of Ruby.

# Fibonacci Sequence

# I worked on this challenge [by myself.
# This challenge took me [1] hours.

# Pseudocode

# 1. Create an array with first two values
# 2. Iterate over the array, and add a value to the end of the array that equals the sum of
# the first two values, starting with the first value
# 3. Move to the next value in the array and repeat step two
# 4. Check if the array contains the input number
# 5. Print true if contains number, and false if it doesn't
# 6. END


# Initial Solution

def is_fibonacci?(num)
  fibonacci = [0, 1]
  i = 0
  fibonacci.each do |i|
    while fibonacci.last < num
      fibonacci.push(fibonacci[i] + fibonacci[i + 1])
      i += 1
    end
  end
  p fibonacci.include?(num)
end

# Refactored Solution

def is_fibonacci?(num)
  fibonacci = [0, 1]
  i = 0
  fibonacci.each do |i|
    while fibonacci.last < num
      fibonacci.push(fibonacci[i] + fibonacci[i + 1])
      i += 1
    end
  end
  p fibonacci.include?(num)
end

# Reflection
# What concepts did you review or learn in this challenge?
#   Iterating over arrays, and utilizing variables as indices.

# FizzBuzz Super Edition

# I worked on this challenge [by myself].
# This challenge took me [0.5] hours.

# Pseudocode

# 1. Iterate through the input array
# 2. If the value in the array is evenly divisable by 15 assign the value to "FizzBuzz"
# 3. If the value in the array is evenly divisable by 5 assign the value to "Buzz"
# 4. If the value in the array is evenly divisable by 3 assign the value to "Fizz"
# 5. Make sure the array values are being modified
# 6. When done iterating, print the array
# 7. END

# Initial Solution

def super_fizzbuzz(array)
  array.map! do |num|
    if num % 15 == 0
      num = "FizzBuzz"
    elsif num % 5 == 0
      num = "Buzz"
    elsif num % 3 == 0
      num = "Fizz"
    else
      num = num
    end
  end 
  p array
end

# Refactored Solution

def super_fizzbuzz(array)
  array.map! do |num|
    if num % 15 == 0
      num = "FizzBuzz"
    elsif num % 5 == 0
      num = "Buzz"
    elsif num % 3 == 0
      num = "Fizz"
    else
      num = num
    end
  end 
  p array
end

# Reflection
# What concepts did you review or learn in this challenge?
#   Using the map method to permanently modify the array so that I would just return
#   the original array at the end.
