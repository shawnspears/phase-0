# FizzBuzz Super Edition

# I worked on this challenge [by myself].
# This challenge took me [0.5] hours.

# Pseudocode

# 1. Iterate through the input array
# 2. If the value in the array is evenly divisable by 15 assign the value to "FizzBuzz"
# 3. If the value in the array is evenly divisable by 5 assign the value to "Buzz"
# 4. If the value in the array is evenly divisable by 3 assign the value to "Fizz"
# 5. Make sure the array values are being modified
# 6. When done iterating, print the array
# 7. END

# Initial Solution

def super_fizzbuzz(array)
  array.map! do |num|
    if num % 15 == 0
      num = "FizzBuzz"
    elsif num % 5 == 0
      num = "Buzz"
    elsif num % 3 == 0
      num = "Fizz"
    else
      num = num
    end
  end 
  p array
end

# Refactored Solution

def super_fizzbuzz(array)
  array.map! do |num|
    if num % 15 == 0
      num = "FizzBuzz"
    elsif num % 5 == 0

    elsif num % 3 == 0
      num = "Fizz"
    else
      num = num
    end
