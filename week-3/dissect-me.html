 		<h1>GPS 1.2: The Anatomy of HTML</h1>
 		<section>
 			<h2>Summary</h2>
 			<p>
 				Welcome to HTML Anatomy 101. In this class, you will do the learn how to dissect an HTML page from the &lt;head&gt; to the &lt;footer&gt;, add a new feature to Sublime Text, and mark up your previous blog posts with semantic HTML tags. So get your gloves on, open your textbook (the HTML docs (Links to an external site.)) and begin!

 			<h2>Release 0: Set up</h2>
 			<p>
 				Before you can get started, you'll need to get setup for the challenge. Decide who is going to drive and who will navigate. Then each of you will need to:
 			</p>
 			<ul>
 				<li>Create a feature branch in the phase-0 directory</li>
 				<li>Using the command line, navigate to the week-3 directory</li>
 				<li>Within that directory, (using the command line) create a blank HTML page called dissect-me.html.</li>
 				<li>Add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub. Create a quick pull request and merge the changes. </li>
 				<li>SUBMIT your link to the dissect-me.html file as soon as you do this. This is how your guide will give you feedback. The URL should be something like: <a href="https://github.com/aalcesto23/phase-0/blob/master/week-3/dissect-me.html">https://github.com/[USERNAME]/phase-0/blob/master/week-3/dissect-me.html</a> (Links to an external site.)</li>
 			</ul>
 			<p>
 				NOTE: You should decide whether to trade roles in each release or change roles half way through the session. If you decide to switch from release to release, you'll want to share code easily using a collaborative editor (or even a simple google doc).

1. What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

	The HTML5 tags used in this challenge that are returned to often are the semantic tags that we've gone over quite a bit in the past couple of weeks. In this particular case we used <main> and <section> to identify which portions of the webpage were associated with what layout element. As we recreated the GPS 1.2 page on canvas, we decided that the <main> element would consist of the different <sections> (that we defined as each of the releases) for the chellenge. We continue to refer back to this concept of utilizing semantic elements because they are significant in the layout organization of any HTML page for a variety of factors: accessbility, readability, and simply for standardization amonng dev teams.

2. How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
	
	Elements are laid out on a page depending on the way that it is nested in relation to other elements. For example, an <article> might have different <sections> nested within in, and thus the page layout is depending on the element location in reference to the other elements. The brower displays the elements in the order in which it occurs on the DOM tree, starting with high branches on the tree (elements), and moving down to their children, and grandchildren, etc.
	
3. What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist? 

	I learned about a very effective tool that allows you to build templates to access later! I would imagine that this would come in handy in building a header/footer that would occur on every page of a site potentially? There probably are a variety of different uses for the tool, and I'm excited to start experimenting with it. I also think researching Sublime shortcuts is the next step that I need to do in order to become more efficient at programming, as I don't always believe I'm being as efficient as possible.
