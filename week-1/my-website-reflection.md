Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
> In order to create a repository, sign into GitHub, click on the plus sign in the upper right hand corner, and select "New Repository" from the drop-down menu. You can then name your repo, select the settings, and create the repository.

In order to clone the repository to your local computer, go to the repo's page on GitHub, and copy the HTTPS clone URL located under the settings on the right side of the screen. Open up terminal, and type in "git clone URL".

Describe what open source means.
> Open source licenses essentially allow for the software to be freely and legally used, modified, and shared without special permission. Although it protects you as the creator of the software, some open source licenses allow for the monitization of the software. Open source licenses allows for a user to have access to the source code of the software, making edits and custimzation possible.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
> I really like the idea of Open Source! I like the notion of people coming together simply because they want to contribute to something meaningful for others. Although its somewhat unfortunate that it is possible for others to profit off of open source, I definitely think that open source organizations are doing a great thing by inspiring an environment of creativity and selflessness in making software that is a part of others' lives. If it makes someone nervous or protective over their software, there is definitely the option of not having it be open source so it isn't as if you are being backed into a corner. Adobe has to stay in business somehow.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
> The importance of using a license lies in the ways in which others are able to utilize your software which is highly significant based upon what the software aims to accomplish.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did 
you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
> YES. I swear I had been banging my head on the wall attempting to magically conjure a pull-request on my repository until I realized I had not been pushing the changes properly! Once I managed to properly merge the changes from the master into the feature branch and THEN push the feature branch to the remote fork, the pull request finally popped up on GitHub. I could have cried. Definitely stuggled with merging until I DIDN'T!

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
> No I didn't! I thought that the resources provided on licensing and open source had already allowed me to understand the foundations of the concepts that we had covered.
