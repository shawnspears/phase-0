# Pad an Array

# I worked on this challenge [with: Natasha Thapliyal]

# I spent [] hours on this challenge.


# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.



# 0. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# (array, integer, integer/string)

# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?
#  The output would be an array with the value appended to the array to meet the min_size requirement.

# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
#  Take the array and compare to min_size
#  While array.length is less than the min_size append the value onto the array
# End while loop when array is min_size
# Return array
# End method

# 1. Initial Solution

# Initial Solution Round 1
def pad!(array, min_size, value = nil) #destructive
  
  while array.length < min_size do
    array << value
  end
  array
  
end

# Initial Solution Round 1
def pad(array, min_size, value = nil) #non-destructive
  while array.length <= min_size do
    array << value
  end
  p array
end

# 3. Refactored Solution

# Refactored Solution Round 1
def pad!(array, min_size, value = nil) #destructive
  while array.length < min_size do
    array << value
  end
  array
end

# Refactored Solution Round 2
def pad!(array, min_size, value = nil)
  p array.fill(value, array.length, min_size-array.length)
end

# Refactored Solution Round 1
def pad(array, min_size, value = nil) #non-destructive
  new_array = [] + array
  while new_array.length < min_size do
    new_array << value
  end
  p new_array
end

# Refactored Solution Round 2
def pad(array, min_size, value = nil)
  new_array = [] + array
  p new_array.fill(value, array.length, min_size-array.length)
end


# 4. Reflection
Were you successful in breaking the problem down into small steps?
Once you had written your pseudocode, were you able to easily translate it into code? What difficulties and successes did you have?
Was your initial solution successful at passing the tests? If so, why do you think that is? If not, what were the errors you encountered and what did you do to resolve them?
When you refactored, did you find any existing methods in Ruby to clean up your code?
How readable is your solution? Did you and your pair choose descriptive variable names?
What is the difference between destructive and non-destructive methods in your own words?
