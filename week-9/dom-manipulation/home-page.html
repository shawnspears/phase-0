What did you learn about the DOM?
  I think the most important take away from this challenge was that you can access
  different nodes in the DOM via "getting them by their ID" and then manipulate them
  using DOM methods. Apparently everything is considered a node in the DOM, so that's
  fun. In classes, its a tad annoying because every node associated with a class has
  an index.

What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM? 
  document.getElementById("id").innerHTML = "new text" - retrieves the appropriate node
  from the DOM and changes the text within that node.

  document.getElementById("id").style.property = "value" - here you can change the css
  of a particular node based on the property/values you indicate (this is so much more
  messy than jquery!).

  document.getElementsByClassName("class") - similar to getElementById, except that each
  node associated with a class has an index and therefore you have to use a for loop to
  make sure you iterate over all of the nodes in the class (again, in jquery this is much
  less complicated).
